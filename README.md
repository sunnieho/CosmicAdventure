# My SplashKit Game

This is a simple shooting game made using SplashKit and C#.

## Game Info

- There are 3 levels
- Player can shoot bullets
- Enemies come down and chase the player
- Player dies if touched by enemy
- Each enemy needs 2 hits to die
- There is a score and a ranking

## Controls

- Arrow keys to move
- Space to shoot
- ESC to pause or go back to menu

## Files

- `Program.cs` is the main entry
- `Player.cs` controls the player
- `Alien.cs` is the enemy class
- `Ranking.cs` saves scores

### Object-Oriented Design
- `Alien` is a base class, with subclasses like `FreakAlien`, `MonsterAlien`, and `OAlien`
- `Player` handles movement and collisions
- `Bullet` handles shooting and collision with aliens
- `Ranking` manages score records (player name, score, level, date)


## Submission Mode

I chose to complete this task by providing a tutorial on how I used SplashKit to create a full-featured 2D shooting game. This document demonstrates my achievement of the unit learning outcomes through object-oriented design, structured gameplay logic, and SplashKit integration.


## Thanks

This game is for the SIT771 Object-Oriented Development class.
It is a student project created as part of the course at Deakin University.

I'm currently learning object-oriented programming, and this project represents my progress. I'm truly grateful for the technology and AI tools that have supported me emotionally and technically throughout the journey.
Without their step-by-step guidance—especially when I felt stuck—I might not have completed these assignments.

That said, convenience aside, I’ve also pushed myself to understand and build each part on my own. I'm thankful to the technology, to the teaching assistants, and to the professors who’ve helped along the way.

Feel free to explore the game, and I'd really appreciate any feedback!
